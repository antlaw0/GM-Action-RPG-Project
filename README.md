# GM-Action-RPG-Project
Project made from Agent X engine
I took the latest version of Agent X and am now calling it RPGX. I plan to make this a general base for all future action rpg projects, currently, it is a 3rd person modern shooter but can be adapted for other genres if needed.
Idea- different branches for different types, medieval fantasy, sci-fi, etc.
